It was not on the book, but I found some sources to seek...
Chapter four was about functions and the structure of a program.
It covered the pattern of a function, what are it's entries,
the scope of it's variables, and a special variable, the registers, 
which are the super blaster mega fast slot in the memory that helps,
specially if some data need to be called often.
To use them it's simple. Just go like "register int x ;"
I like to think about it as the cache on the python functions, 
(It kinda is the cache in the python functions).
Also, the difference between declaration and definition on a function.
Seen recursion, the preprocessor, what are the #define, #include,
what are the impacts of them in our code, and the #define as a 
macro, with the macro-processor.
