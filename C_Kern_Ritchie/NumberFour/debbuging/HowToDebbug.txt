- We can debug (no need to keep recompiling)
    - We have a tool called gdb
    $ sudo apt install gdb
    - It can tell us some runtime problems that
    our compilation wasn't aware of (remember the runtime errors?)
    - It can keep the track of our variables and other things. So...
    It's yet another thing to learn.
    - When we program in python there's no problem with it, 'cause
    our program is interpreted, so, it gives us some time.
    $ gcc -g main.c -o main
    $ gdb main
    And then... Need to learn how to debug our code with the
